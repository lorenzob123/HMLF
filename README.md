# Hmlf Project

This library is a fork of StableBaselines3 with the focus on parametrized action spaces. This library makes it easier to work with environments where the tasks to perform have a discrete componente and a continuos one. The main focus for us is to use the HMLF in controlling robots through human-embedded skills with parameters to tune.
