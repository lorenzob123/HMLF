Hybrid Reinforcement Learning Resources
================================


HMLF assumes you are familiar with reinforcement learning and in particular with the parametrized action literature

However, if you want to learn about RL, there are several good resources to get started:

- `OpenAI Spinning Up <https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/>`_
- `David Silver's course <http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html>`_
- `Lilian Weng's blog <https://lilianweng.github.io/lil-log/2018/04/08/policy-gradient-algorithms.html>`_
- `Berkeley's Deep RL Bootcamp <https://sites.google.com/view/deep-rl-bootcamp/lectures>`_
- `Berkeley's Deep Reinforcement Learning course <http://rail.eecs.berkeley.edu/deeprlcourse/>`_
- `More resources <https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning>`_


For the main papers on the parametrized actions in reinforcement learning
