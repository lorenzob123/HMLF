    """
    Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG).

    Deterministic Policy Gradient: http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/silver14.pdf
    DDPG Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971
    Introduction to DDPG: https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/algorithms/ddpg.html

    Note: we treat DDPG as a special case of its successor TD3.

    :param policy: The policy model to use (MlpPolicy, CnnPolicy, ...)
    :param env: The environment to learn from (if registered in Gym, can be str)
    :param learning_rate: learning rate for adam optimizer,
        the same learning rate will be used for all networks (Q-Values, Actor and Value function)
        it can be a function of the current progress remaining (from 1 to 0)
    :param buffer_size: size of the replay buffer
    :param learning_starts: how many steps of the model to collect transitions for before learning starts
    :param batch_size: Minibatch size for each gradient update
    :param tau: the soft update coefficient ("Polyak update", between 0 and 1)
    :param gamma: the discount factor
    :param train_freq: Update the model every ``train_freq`` steps. Set to `-1` to disable.
    :param gradient_steps: How many gradient steps to do after each rollout
        (see ``train_freq`` and ``n_episodes_rollout``)
        Set to ``-1`` means to do as many gradient steps as steps done in the environment
        during the rollout.
    :param n_episodes_rollout: Update the model every ``n_episodes_rollout`` episodes.
        Note that this cannot be used at the same time as ``train_freq``. Set to `-1` to disable.
    :param action_noise: the action noise type (None by default), this can help
        for hard exploration problem. Cf common.noise for the different action noise type.
    :param optimize_memory_usage: Enable a memory efficient variant of the replay buffer
        at a cost of more complexity.
        See https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3/issues/37#issuecomment-637501195
    :param create_eval_env: Whether to create a second environment that will be
        used for evaluating the agent periodically. (Only available when passing string for the environment)
    :param policy_kwargs: additional arguments to be passed to the policy on creation
    :param verbose: the verbosity level: 0 no output, 1 info, 2 debug
    :param seed: Seed for the pseudo random generators
    :param device: Device (cpu, cuda, ...) on which the code should be run.
        Setting it to auto, the code will be run on the GPU if possible.
    :param _init_setup_model: Whether or not to build the network at the creation of the instance
